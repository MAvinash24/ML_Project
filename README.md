# Live Telugu Speech Recognition

A real-time speech-to-text transcription system for Telugu using a pretrained ASR model.

## Overview

This project uses the `Harveenchadha/vakyansh-wav2vec2-telugu-tem-100` model from Hugging Face to convert Telugu speech into text in real-time. The system captures live audio through your earphone's microphone and processes it using modern deep learning libraries.

## Features

- **Real-Time Transcription:** Captures and transcribes Telugu speech live.
- **Pretrained ASR Model:** Utilizes a state-of-the-art model created by [Harveenchadha](https://huggingface.co/Harveenchadha).
- **Interactive Development:** Built and debugged using VS Code with the Jupyter extension.

## Libraries and Tools

- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/):** Deep learning framework for model computations.
- **[Torchaudio](https://pytorch.org/audio/):** Audio processing capabilities integrated with PyTorch.
- **[Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/):** Access to pretrained models, including our ASR model.
- **[Sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/):** Captures live audio input.
- **[Numpy](https://numpy.org/):** Array operations and data manipulation.
- **[Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/):** Additional audio file handling and signal processing.
